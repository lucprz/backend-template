## Backend Template

##### As a first goal this template aims to create a standard for future projects with Node and TypeScript.

##### Secondly, it aims to create a template that is maintainable over time, so it will be updated as the different versions of all its components are updated.

##### Feel free to use it and let me know if there is anything you would add or improve.

##### Thank you!
